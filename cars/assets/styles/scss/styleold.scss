Stylesheet: Main Stylesheet

Here's where the magic happens. Here is where you import
all of your Sass files so they can compile into one
CSS file.

// Import local Foundation overrides - Don't link to Bower version as it will be overwritten whenever updated
@import "settings";

// Import foundation.scss from vendor files
@import "../../../node_modules/foundation-sites/scss/foundation";


// Select the components you want to use
@include foundation-global-styles;
@include foundation-xy-grid-classes;

@include foundation-flex-classes;
@include foundation-typography;
@include foundation-dropdown;
@include foundation-dropdown-menu;
@include foundation-responsive-embed;
